My name is **Raul Larosa**, and I'm a fourth year IT student & aspiring sysadmin from Milan, Italy. As of this page's last update, I am 18 years old.

While I previously dedicated most of my free time to Roblox development, I have slowly been moving away from the platform to familiarize myself with other toolchains. I am currently learning Rust, C#, and Java, with a focus on the last.

I have an interest in furry art and 2D side-scroller games like [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) and [Rain World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/). I tend to obsess over my favorite media a *lot*, especially when it comes to lore and technical implementations. As you can probably tell, foxes are my favorite animal.
